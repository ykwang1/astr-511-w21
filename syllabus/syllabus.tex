\leftline{\bf  Homeworks and term project}

There will be two homeworks, designed as practical warm-up projects to prepare you
for the term project towards the quarter's end. They will be similar from the technical 
point of view: they will involve reading a number of vectors with several million elements 
from provided files (using Python and Jupyter notebooks) followed by simple operations 
with these vectors such as binning, low-order statistics and luminosity function estimation
(ok, this one is not very simple but the code will be provided), and visualization of your results. 

The homework problem description and links to data files will be posted at the class website 
about two weeks before the homework is due (due dates: January 26 for HW1 and February 18 for HW2).

The term project will be based on the recently released Gaia Early Data Release 3 and a few
auxiliary datasets (e.g., ZTF and WISE). More details will be provided during January and
discussed in class on Jan 26. 

We will use modern software engineering tools, such as github for version control and Jupyter 
notebooks, for HW submission and work on the term project.

These papers are very relevant for our class and cover subjects that are
not going to be discussed in detail. Choose a paper and prepare a 20 min long 
Powerpoint (or equivalent) presentation
(presumably including the most important figures from the paper). Pretend 
you did the work yourself and are giving an invited talk at a meeting. 
There will be about 10-15 min long question and answer session after the talk,
with everyone participating. 
The purpose of this exercise is to 1) learn some science, 2) practice 
extracting relevant information from papers 3) practice giving talks,
4) practice answering questions from your audience.

Do not forget the following good practices: 
1) empty your pockets (no loose change, keys, phone, and such),
2) talk slowly and sufficently loud, 3) don't look at the floor, control
your audience with direct eye contact, don't turn your back to the audience, 
don't be agressive with the pointer, etc. 4) don't rush (don't overload 
your 10 min long presentation), concentrate on the most important points,
5) emphasize what are truly new, and, possibly, unexpected results.
6) comment on the limitations and pitfalls of the presented analysis;
how do we know it's right, could it be wrong?

To-do:
- update http://research.majuric.org/public/teaching/astr511/  to Winter2021. 
- shall we just keep our ARAA review, or add disk and halo from Helmi and ??
- new homeworks:
   1) Gaia EDR3: produce HR diagram and color-code by: counts, pm, apparent magnitude, distance (aML code)
               Stripe 82 or whole sky or NGP? 
     -> perhaps look at selection in https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2019/03/aa33304-18.pdf
   2) simulated WD sample - luminosity function 
   3) Gaia EDR and Stripe 82: calibrate photometric parallax (including FeH), and produce FeH maps, vtan maps 
           search for substructure,
